- Led the initiative to rebuild the website with Next.js and TypeScript, from the initial tech research through implementation, including a custom authentication system that integrated with the existing Ruby on Rails / Backbone.js website. The rebuild reduced the home page's CSS download size by 79% (54.1kB to 11.3kB) and JS download size by 55% (763kB to 337kB).
- Built the API endpoints needed for the new website on the Rails backend, including SQL database interactions, comprehensive specs, and Swagger documentation.
- Worked hand-in-hand with DevOps to implement a system to release new Next.js pages alongside existing Rails pages, using nginx rewrites.
- Added new features, fixed bugs, and optimized performance on legacy codebases with React, Redux, Backbone.js, Socket.io, Bootstrap CSS, and Ruby on Rails.
- Improved Core Web Vitals on public pages by optimizing JS and CSS requests on those pages, in collaboration with the SEO team.
- Integrated with DevOps using Google Cloud Platform (Build, Storage, CDN), Kubernetes, and Grafana for CI/CD pipelines, asset optimization, deployment management, and monitoring.
- Experience in a microservice-oriented architecture, with services written in Ruby or Elixir and communicating through Google PubSub.
- Worked within a global team spanning the UK, Europe, and USA, with communications held exclusively in English.
